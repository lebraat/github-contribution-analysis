# GitHub Contribution Analyzer

## üöÄ Quick Start for Everyone

### What is this?
This is a simple web tool that helps you understand your GitHub commit activity over the last 3 years. Whether you're a student, professional, or just curious about your coding journey, this app provides insights into your GitHub commits.

### How to Use the App
1. Visit: [https://github-contribution-analysis.vercel.app/](https://github-contribution-analysis.vercel.app/)
2. Enter your GitHub username in the input box
3. Click "Analyze"

### Understanding Your Results

#### Total Days with Commits
- This number shows how many unique days you've made commits in the last 3 years
- If you made multiple commits on the same day, it still counts as just one commit day
- Only counts commits to repositories' default branches
- Only includes commits where you are the author

#### Monthly Commit Chart
- The bar graph shows your commit days by month
- Each bar represents the number of unique days you made commits in that month
- Multiple commits on the same day count as one commit day
- Helps you visualize your coding consistency patterns

### What's Being Counted?
- Each day where you made at least one commit counts as a "commit day"
- Multiple commits on the same day are counted as a single commit day
- Counts commits across all branches
- Only includes commits where you are the author
- Only counts commits that are:
  - Made after your GitHub account was created
  - Made after the repository was created
  - Within the last 3 years
- Currently NOT counting:
  - Pull requests
  - Issues
  - Code reviews
  - Comments

### Tips for Interpreting Your Data
- A high number of commit days shows consistent coding activity
- Gaps in the chart might indicate:
  - Vacation periods
  - Busy times in your personal or professional life
  - Shifts in project focus

### Privacy and Security
- We only read public information from your GitHub profile
- No personal data is stored or shared

### Local Development
1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/lebraat/github-contribution-analysis.git
cd github-contribution-analysis
```

2. Create a virtual environment
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Set up environment variables
Create a `.env` file in the project root:
```
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_personal_access_token
```

5. Run the application
```bash
python api/index.py
```

### Vercel Deployment
1. Fork the repository
2. Connect to Vercel
3. Add environment variable `GITHUB_TOKEN`

## Environment Variables
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: GitHub Personal Access Token with `read:user` scope

## API Limitations
- Queries contributions for the last 3 years
- Uses GitHub GraphQL API with rate limiting considerations

## Contributing
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch
3. Commit your changes
4. Push to the branch
5. Create a Pull Request
